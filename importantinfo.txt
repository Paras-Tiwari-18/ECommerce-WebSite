Correct Way to Find a Listing and Get a Product by Product ID
If you want to get a product by productid inside a Listing, you should use Mongoose's .findOne() with $elemMatch:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const listing = await Listings.findOne(
    { _id: id, products: productid } // Check if the product exists in the listing
);
This query finds the Listing document where:

_id: id matches the listing ID.
products array contains productid.
If You Need Only the Product from the Array
If products is an array of objects and you want to retrieve only the matching product, use $elemMatch:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const listing = await Listings.findOne(
    { _id: id, "products._id": productid },
    { "products.$": 1 } // Projection to get only the matched product
);
If You Meant to Remove a Product from the Listing
If you actually wanted to remove a product from the products array in the Listing, then use $pull like this:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const listing = await Listings.findByIdAndUpdate(
    id,
    { $pull: { products: productid } }, // Remove product from the array
    { new: true } // Return updated document
);
