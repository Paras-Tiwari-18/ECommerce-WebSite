Mongo Db does not contains strict schema and one such use case is that when i saw that the blinkit is able to save description which is different in case of chips and diferent with every product and here come the play of mongodb which is nosql database it can directly store the data in json format in the data base without a predefined schema hence as we know the from sends data on submit in the form of json format can directly be stored in database just by defining a collection




MongoDB is a NoSQL database, meaning it does not enforce a strict schema like SQL databases. This is exactly why platforms like Blinkit can handle dynamic product descriptions for different products without any issue.

🔹 Why MongoDB is a Good Fit for Blinkit?
1️⃣ No Fixed Schema: Different products (chips, soap, mobile, etc.) have different attributes. MongoDB allows storing data without a predefined structure.
2️⃣ Stores Data as JSON: Since the frontend sends form data as JSON, it can be directly stored in MongoDB without extra processing.
3️⃣ Scalability: Handles millions of products and changes efficiently.
4️⃣ Flexibility: You can add or remove fields dynamically without affecting other documents in the collection.

🔹 Example: How Blinkit Might Store Products in MongoDB
🍟 Chips Data

{
  "product_name": "Uncle Chipps",
  "category": "Snacks",
  "price": 20,
  "attributes": {
    "flavour": "Spicy Treat",
    "unit": "48g",
    "ingredients": ["Potato", "Vegetable Oil", "Salt"]
  }
}
📱 Mobile Data

{
  "product_name": "Samsung Galaxy S24",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 79999,
  "attributes": {
    "RAM": "12GB",
    "Storage": "256GB",
    "Battery": "5000mAh"
  }
}
👉 Notice how "attributes" differ for each product? MongoDB allows this without any predefined schema!

🔹 How This Works in Code?
1️⃣ Frontend (React) Sends JSON

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await fetch("/api/products", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(product),
  });
};
2️⃣ Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) Stores JSON

app.post("/api/products", async (req, res) => {
  const product = req.body;
  await db.collection("products").insertOne(product);
  res.json({ message: "Product saved successfully!" });
});
🎯 No need to define columns! MongoDB directly stores the JSON as a document.

🔹 Final Answer
Yes, MongoDB's schema-less nature makes it a great choice for storing dynamic product details like in Blinkit.
Since the form submits data in JSON format, it can be directly stored in a MongoDB collection without a predefined schema. 🎉
